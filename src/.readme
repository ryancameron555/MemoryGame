## What It Does

Remember those memory card games you played as a kid? This is that, but with a sleek poker table design. Flip cards, find matching pairs, and try to beat your best score. Simple concept, surprisingly addictive.

## Features

- **30 cards to match** - Find all 15 pairs to win
- **Score tracking** - Your best scores are saved locally (lower is better!)
- **Timer & move counter** - See how fast and efficient you can be
- **Pause/Resume** - Take a break without losing your progress
- **How to Play guide** - Auto-shows for first-time players
- **Fully responsive** - Works great on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Poker table theme** - Because everything looks cooler with a felt background

## How Scoring Works

Your score = Time (in seconds) + (Moves × 2)

So finishing in 60 seconds with 25 moves = 60 + 50 = **110 points**

Lower scores are better! Try to use fewer moves and finish faster.

## Tech Stack

- React 18
- Vite
- CSS3 (no frameworks needed)
- LocalStorage for score persistence

## Design Choices

**Why the poker table look?** 
It just felt right for a card game. Plus, the dark green felt background is easy on the eyes during long play sessions.

**Why no card flip animations?**
Actually, there are! They're subtle CSS transforms that happen when you click a card. Not overly flashy, just smooth.

**Why LocalStorage instead of a database?**
For a simple memory game, there's no need for a backend. Your scores stay on your device, and it works offline. Win-win.

## Future Ideas

- Difficulty levels (more cards, different grid sizes)
- Different card themes (not just playing cards)
- Sound effects (optional, toggleable)
- Multiplayer mode (take turns, see who's better)
- Dark mode toggle
